1) create a table "Student"

	rollno,name,age

write a java program to accept rollno,name,age from user and insert a row.

after inserting that row try to view using a query.


2) create table "Employee"
	empid,empname,desig

	add 5 records manually.

   Now write a java program to accept "designation" from user and retrieve employees with the given designation.


3) Object Persistence inside database

create a table "Product" with
	pid number
	qty number
	cost decimal
	pname varchar
[ do not add any record ]

define a class "Product" with
	private int pid,qty;
	private double cost;
	private String pname;
		setters,getters,parameterized constructor and toString()

create 1 instance of above class , display it and then insert a row inside Product with the help of above instance.

	now assign "null" to the above instance. That means your heap based object will be soon garbage collected , but you need not worry as you have saved the state of an object inside the database.

	now fire a query to read that record and with the help of it initialize new object of "Product" and display it.
